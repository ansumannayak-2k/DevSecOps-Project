What is DevSecOps? : DevSecOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev), security (Sec), and IT operations (Ops) with the goal of integrating security measures and processes into the software development lifecycle. The term is a combination of "Development," "Security," and "Operations." DevSecOps aims to address the traditional approach where security is often treated as a separate entity and is added on at the end of the development process.

Key aspects of DevSecOps:
Integration of Security into DevOps Practices: DevSecOps emphasizes the need to integrate security practices seamlessly into the development and operations processes. It encourages collaboration and communication between development, security, and operations teams.

Automation: Automation is a fundamental principle of DevSecOps. By automating security processes and checks, organizations can identify and address vulnerabilities more efficiently and consistently throughout the development lifecycle.

Continuous Monitoring: DevSecOps involves continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. This proactive approach helps organizations identify and address security issues as soon as they arise.

Shift Left: DevSecOps promotes the "shift left" principle, meaning that security is addressed early in the development process rather than as a later-stage consideration. This helps catch and fix security issues at the earliest possible stages, reducing the cost and impact of addressing vulnerabilities later in the development lifecycle.

Culture of Collaboration and Responsibility: DevSecOps emphasizes a cultural shift toward collaboration and shared responsibility for security across development, security, and operations teams. It encourages a mindset where everyone involved in the software development process has a role in ensuring security.

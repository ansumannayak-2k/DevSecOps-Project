# Devsecops-Project using AWS
**What is DevSecOps? :** DevSecOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev), security (Sec), and IT operations (Ops) with the goal of integrating security measures and processes into the software development lifecycle. The term is a combination of "Development," "Security," and "Operations." DevSecOps aims to address the traditional approach where security is often treated as a separate entity and is added on at the end of the development process.

# Key aspects of DevSecOps:
1. **Integration of Security into DevOps Practices:** DevSecOps emphasizes the need to integrate security practices seamlessly into the development and operations processes. It encourages collaboration and communication between development, security, and operations teams.

2. **Automation:** Automation is a fundamental principle of DevSecOps. By automating security processes and checks, organizations can identify and address vulnerabilities more efficiently and consistently throughout the development lifecycle.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:** DevSecOps involves continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. This proactive approach helps organizations identify and address security issues as soon as they arise.

4. **Shift Left:** DevSecOps promotes the "shift left" principle, meaning that security is addressed early in the development process rather than as a later-stage consideration. This helps catch and fix security issues at the earliest possible stages, reducing the cost and impact of addressing vulnerabilities later in the development lifecycle.

5. **Culture of Collaboration and Responsibility:** DevSecOps emphasizes a cultural shift toward collaboration and shared responsibility for security across development, security, and operations teams. It encourages a mindset where everyone involved in the software development process has a role in ensuring security.

# Tools and technologies used in this project
1. **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
   - **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Deploying virtual machines (EC2 instances) to run applications and services.
   - **Security Groups and IAM:** Configuring network security and managing access control through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

2. **Jenkins:**
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications.
   - **Security Scanning:** Integrating security scans into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
   - **Managing credentials:** Credentials such as Dockerhub credentials and sonar server tokens.

3. **SonarQube:**
   - **Code Quality Analysis:** Scanning code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
   - **Static Code Analysis:** Identifying security vulnerabilities in the source code before deployment.

4. **Trivy:**
   - **Container Security Scanning:** Scanning container images for vulnerabilities and ensuring that only secure images are deployed.
   - **Integration with CI/CD:** Automating vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Docker:**
   - **Containerization:** Packaging applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment.
   - **Isolation:** Enhancing security by isolating applications and their dependencies within containers.

6. **Kubernetes:**
   - **Orchestration:** Managing and orchestrating containerized applications at scale.
   - **Security Policies:** Implementing security policies for pods and clusters to control access and prevent unauthorized actions.
   - **Secrets Management:** Safely managing sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials.
